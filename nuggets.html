    <h2>About the recipe</h2>
    <p>These are a healthier version of a classic dish. The texture may be very unique and not for the faint of hearth.</p>
    <p>The first time that I myself made this recipe it almost ended my relationship. I can't say it gets easier, but it sure is rewarding when those actually come out right.</p>
    <p>It is an experience that every person should strive to. Once you make and try these, I guarantee your life will never be the same.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A whole chicken (yes)</li>
        <li>An onion that reminds you of an ogre</li>
        <li>Crumbs of a once loved bread</li>
        <li>Your favorite cheese</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven at hellish temperatures</li>
        <li>Pray and sacrifice the chicken in the name of your favorite <strong>entity</strong></li>
        <li>Rip your chicken to pieces with your bare hands. Finish with a properly consecrate knife</li>
        <li>Alchemy your way into fusing the destroyed chicken with the onion and the bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Manipulate the hauting <i>meat-ish</i> mass into byte size nuggies</li>
        <li>Burn it until a miracle happen</li>
        <li>Your recipe is ready!</li>
    </ol>
